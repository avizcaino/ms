        "bio":"An accomplished and striking performer, Academy Award® nominee Casey Affleck has established himself as a powerful leading man with performances in multiple upcoming projects. Affleck will next be seen starring opposite Michelle Williams in Manchester by the Sea. The film tells the story of an uncle (Affleck) who is forced to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, the film will be released on November 18th by Amazon Studios. Affleck was last seen in Triple 9 opposite Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet. The film follows a gang of criminals and corrupt cops who plan to murder a police office in order to pull off their biggest heist yet. The film was released by Open Road in February. Additionally, Affleck starred in The Finest Hours opposite Chris Pine. The Disney film recounts the story of the Coast Guard's daring rescue attempt off the coast of Cape Cod after a pair of oil tankers are destroyed during a blizzard in 1952. Additional credits include Christopher Nolan's Interstellar opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, and Anne Hathaway; Out of the Furnace opposite Christian Bale; and Ain't Them Bodies Saints opposite Rooney Mara. Affleck was nominated for an Academy Award®, Golden Globe®, and Screen Actors Guild® Award for his performance in the character drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (\"Chopper\"), the Warner Bros. film stars Affleck as 'Ford' opposite Brad Pitt's 'Jesse James.' The story follows 'Ford's' sycophantic obsession with 'James' that quickly turns into growing resentment after he joins the legendary outlaw's gang, leading to his subsequent plan to murder 'James' and claim his rightful glory. Additionally, Casey garnered significant praise for his starring role in the Miramax film Gone, Baby Gone. Based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title, and adapted for the screen and featuring the directorial debut by Ben Affleck, the film is the story of two Boston detectives in search of a four-year-old girl who has been kidnapped. The film also stars Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and Michelle Monaghan. In 2014, Affleck and John Powers Middleton formed The Affleck/Middleton Project, a full service production company designed to develop and produce film and television content across a variety of genres. With a mission to produce quality films and television series that connect with audiences, The Affleck/Middleton Project looks to develop and produce a new wave of great American entertainment. It was recently announced that The Affleck/Middleton Project has secured the rights to Far Bright Star, the second in the book series of the same name by 'Robert Olmstead;' Affleck will direct a script by Damien Ober with three-time Academy Award® nominee Joaquin Phoenix set to star. Affleck also directed I'm Still Here, which he also wrote and produced starring Joaquin Phoenix. On stage, Casey appeared in Kenneth Lonergan's West End debut of his award winning play This is Our Youth. Affleck played the role of 'Warren' alongside Matt Damon and Summer Phoenix. Affleck also co-wrote with and starred alongside Matt Damon in Gus Van Sant's independent road movie Gerry. He has also appeared in Van Sant's Good Will Hunting and To Die For, Hamlet with Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles, the Oceans trilogy and Tony Goldwyn's The Last Kiss with Zach Braff and Blythe Danner.",

I haven't really done all that many interviews, partly by choice, and partly because no one's been all that interested. Now things are getting different [referring to the success of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)].",
          "[on his working relationship with brother Ben Affleck] It was easy mostly because we kind of just spoke the same language and were very comfortable saying to each other, \"I think that's a terrible idea . . . \" or \"That's a great idea but what if . . . ?\" We could sort of build on each other's excitement. We had a kind of shorthand.",

          "I believe veganism can be beneficial for the individual and the world, and of course the animal, but belief is like laying in the dark with someone and telling them you love them and hearing nothing back. So I've never had the confidence to get on a soapbox and tell someone else what to do",
          "I love taking a risk. If I'm a little bit afraid of a part, that's the first indication that it's going to be good for me. If I can't find that element of risk in the material, I always hope that the director is going to be open to taking chances. With this movie ['Out of The Furnace'] I was lucky enough to have both elements. The material was different, difficult and a little bit scary. As a director Scott [Cooper] fostered an environment where risk was the common currency. We knew we were going to take risks, even if it meant making mistakes. And that's the best kind of experience.",
          "[on working with Christopher Nolan in Interstellar] There is not much I can say except that it's pretty incredible to work with somebody who is on top of his game. He is not only very talented, but also very successful. He has the keys to the kingdom in a way. He's got every tool in his disposal; every tool he wants. It makes for a very interesting set. I kinda felt privileged just to be hanging out and watching him work. He sets a really nice tone on the set; everyone is very relaxed. It probably costs a million dollar a minute just to be there."
